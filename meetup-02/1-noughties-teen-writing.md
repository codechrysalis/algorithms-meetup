# Noughties Teen Writing

## Summary

Teenagers who grew up in the noughties (2000-2010) were the first to really experience the power of the internet in adolescence.

To stand out, some teens wrote in sUcH a fAsHiOn where every other letter was written in caps.

Let's write a function that turns writing into noughties teen language :)

Quick note:

1. Unless it is the beginning of a sentence (or the below), the first letter of every word should be lowercase.
2. 'I' is always lowercase, even when it is in the beginning of a sentence.

## Input

A string!

## Output

Another string that "corrects" the input string by turning it iNtO wRiTiNg lIkE tHiS.

## Example

Example 1

Input: 'hello world!'
Output: 'HeLlO wOrLd!'

Example 2

Input: 'I love the algorithms meetup!'
Output: 'i lOvE tHe aLgOrItHmS mEeTuP!'
