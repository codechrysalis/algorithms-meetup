# GetElementsByClassName

## Summary

Learn about how the `document` object in JavaScript is awesome-sauce!

Write a function that gets all the elements on a page by their classname. If you're unfamiliar with what classnames are, time to get learning!

```javascript
var getElementsByClassName = function (className) {
  // YOUR CODE HERE
};
```

## Input

A string for the classname to be 'grabbed'.

## Output

The output should be an array of [Element nodes](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Element), similar to an [HTMLCollection](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/HTMLCollection).

## Example

Check `document.getElementsByClassName` out in your browser console! It should work exactly like that.

## Constraints

You are not allowed to use the native method (`document.getElementsByClassName`), of course.
