# One Step Crypto

## Summary

One of the easiest cryptographic methods is to use a simple cipher to translate a message. For our one step method, you are given a string of text and must change each letter to the next letter of the alphabet.

## Input

A string!

## Output

A string where all of the letters are changed to the next letter in the alphabet.

## Example

* Input: "dog"
* Output: "eph"

* Input: "spaces here"
* Output: "tqbdft ifsf"

## Tips

Try using an object/dictionary/hashmap of the alphabet.
