# Pascal's Triangle

## Summary

**Pascal's Triangle** is a mathematical tool that is used in computing binomials and combinations.

It looks like this:

```
0:                          1
1:                       1     1
2:                    1     2     1
3:                 1     3     3     1
4:              1     4     6     4     1
5:           1     5     10    10    5     1
6:        1     6     15    20    15    6     1
7:     1     7     21    35    35    21    7     1
8:  1     8     28    56    70    56    28    8     1
```

Your mission is to compute a row of _Pascal's Triangle_.

## Input

An integer row index.

## Output

An array of integers that appear (in order) in the row with the given index.

## Example

```
0 --> [1]

1 --> [1, 1]

2 --> [1, 2, 1]

8 --> [1, 8, 28, 56, 70, 56, 28, 8, 1]
```
